# admin_dashboard

This admin dashboard is an exercise in using mostly CSS Grid to create a two dimensional layout. There may be use of FlexBox as well, but the focus will be on grid. There will be no functionality and some degree of responsiveness is intended. 

<h1> Key Takeaways </h1>
1) Grid is significantly more useful for setting up 2-D layouts than using FlexBox.
2) Flexbox and Grid can be used together very effectively (flexbox handling any 1-D placements)
3) Use of auto-fill to allow for a more responsive design (the card section).
4) Using max-height to make other elements not blow up when the auto-fill occurs.
5) Use of SVGs and manipulating them with CSS Grid.
