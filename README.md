# admin_dashboard

This admin dashboard is an exercise in using mostly CSS Grid to create a two dimensional layout. There may be use of FlexBox as well, but the focus will be on grid. There will be no functionality and some degree of responsiveness is intended. 

<h1> Key Takeaways </h1>
<ol>
  <li> Grid is significantly more useful for setting up 2-D layouts than using FlexBox. </li>
<li> Flexbox and Grid can be used together very effectively (flexbox handling any 1-D placements) </li>
<li> Use of auto-fill to allow for a more responsive design (the card section). </li>
<li> Using max-height to make other elements not blow up when the auto-fill occurs. </li>
<li> Use of SVGs and manipulating them with CSS Grid. </li>
</ol>
